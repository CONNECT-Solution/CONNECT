Initialization of XCA RG Test Data

This initializes a Registry/Repository behind an XCA interface for testing the XCA interface.
It loads 2 documents, a small text document and a larger PDF document.


The only configuration needed should be entering your endpoint into the <RegistryEndpoint/> element. If you
do not have a Registry behind your Receiving Gateway then you will need to create the equivalent data.  See
the wiki entry for this test for details.
