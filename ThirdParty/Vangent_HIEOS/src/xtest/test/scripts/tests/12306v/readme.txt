XGQ FindDocuments for ObjectRef

Initiate a FindDocuments Cross-Gateway Query (XGQ) to the Public
Registry server's Responding Gateway for a pre-determined Patient ID. Request ObjectRefs be returned.

The metadata contained in the file testplan.xml is an example of the request.  The content of element 
/TestPlan/TestStep/XCQTransaction/Metadata is the actual request. You must substitute the correct
patient ID for $patient_id$.  

See http://ihewiki.wustl.edu/wiki/index.php/XDS_Test_Kit_2007-2008_Test_Descriptions#12306 
for the Patient ID and Web Service Endpoint currently being used.
