# System properties used by code
# On windows 2000 it is: C:/Documents and Settings/<user> (must use forward slashes)
# On unix it is something like: /home/<user>
# May be used as variable in property values when pre-fixed by $ (e.g. $user.home )
# Referred hereafter as <user.home>
#
# user.home

#
# The instance name for an omar server instance
# Default is omar
# Best to leave it unspecified and go with defaults.
# May be used as variable in property values when pre-fixed by $ (e.g. $omar.name )

#
# The base directory for omar run time files
# Default is <user.home>/omar/<version_tag>

# Configures omar code to run without requiring user registration.
# Valid values are "true" and "false"

# When this property is "true" any unauthenticated request user can access publish
# functionality and server maps requestor to built-in user RegistryOperator.

omar.common.noUserRegistrationRequired=true

#
# The default to use for namespace prefix in the org.freebxml.omar.common.URN.makeValid() method.
# With the value set to "urn:org:acme" by default URNs will be of form urn:org:acme:<urn suffix>
# Customize this for your deployment

#omar.common.URN.defaultNamespacePrefix=urn:org:acme

#
# Max Clock Skew: configuration parameter for xws-security API.
# "The assumed maximum skew (milliseconds) between the local times of any two systems."
# Used for verifying xml signature timestamps (default 1h, quite a lot!)

# SAML based Single Sign On (SSO) mode.
# This mode requires a SAML AUthority such as Sun Java ES Access Manager product

# This property is referenced only in a TODO block of code, presently has no
# effect.

# This property instructs signature verification code on how to treat
# a signature verification error.
#
# false: Do not ignore signature verification errors and throw an
#        Exception if this happens (default)
# true: Ignore signature verification errors and log an error if this
#       happens. This option may need to be used when XWSS libraries
#       older than version 2.0 or when using mixed versions of OMAR for
#       client and server.

org.freebxml.omar.common.security.ignoreSignatureVerificationErrors=false

#
# This property instructs signature verification code on how to log
# a signature verification error. This setting is only used if 
# ignoreSignatureVerificationErrors=true. If ignoreSignatureVerificationErrors=false
# then an exception will be thrown and the error will always be logged as well.
# This is useful when running in development mode. Not recommended for production.
#
# false: Do not log signature verification errors if this happens 
# true: Log signature verification errors (default)
#
org.freebxml.omar.common.security.logSignatureVerificationErrors=true

# The keystore alias to use when looking up the credentials for unauthenticated users. This is only
# applicable if the ebxmlrr web client is deployed as an unsecured web application. If this property
# is not set, the web client will not sign requests it makes to the ebxmlrr server, so the server
# will associate all user requests with the Registry Guest user. If it is set, it is assumed
# that the appropriate public/private key pair have been installed into the client keystore under
# this alias.

# This property is used to set the default locale for omar.common classes.
