 * Started on webapplication init, creates the main ExecutorService and CamelContext instances Note the following: 1.
 * Main ExecutorService creates a new thread pool of size specified on construction, independent/in addition to

 * creates a new thread in this case

 * that get a callable list of size comparable to the size of the main ExecutorService)
