# two types of mailservers supported - "internal" or "external". This determine which messages are handled. 
# internal mail servers handle messages addressed to recipients at domains not listed in "direct.inbound.domains"
# external mail servers handle messages addressed to recipients at domains listed in "direct.inbound.domains"
#direct.mailserver.type=internal

# inbound domain is used to determine if messages are handled as outbound or not handled.
# everything not on this list is treated as outbound.
